## kindle-highlights

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/speric/kindle-highlights.png)](http://travis-ci.org/speric/kindle-highlights)

A Ruby gem for collecting your Kindle highlights.

### Requirements

* Ruby `2.1.0` or greater
* An Amazon Kindle account

### Install
```
gem install kindle-highlights
```

### Use

First, `require` the gem and initialize a new client by passing in the email address & password you use
to sign into your Amazon Kindle account:

```ruby
require 'kindle_highlights'

kindle = KindleHighlights::Client.new(
  email_address: "email.address@gmail.com",
  password: "password"
)
```

### Fetching a list of your Kindle books

Use the `books` method to get a listing of all your Kindle books. This method
returns a collection of `KindleHighlights::Book` objects:

```ruby
kindle.books
#=>
[
  <KindleHighlights::Book:
      @asin="B000XUAETY",
      @author="James R. Mcdonough",
      @title="Platoon Leader: A Memoir of Command in Combat"
  >,
  <KindleHighlights::Book:
    @asin="B003XDUCEU",
    @author="Michael Lopp",
    @title="Being Geek: The Software Developer's Career Handbook"
  >,
  <KindleHighlights::Book:
    @asin="B00JJ1RIO2",
    @author="James K. A. Smith",
    @title="How (Not) to Be Secular: Reading Charles Taylor"
  >
]
```

### Fetching all highlights for a single book

To get only the highlights for a specific book, use the `highlights_for` method, passing
in the book's Amazon ASIN as the only method parameter. This method returns a collection of
`KindleHighlights::Highlight` objects:

```ruby
kindle.highlights_for("B005CQ2ZE6")
#=>
[
  <KindleHighlights::Highlight:0x007fc4e7e03ea0
    @asin="B005CQ2ZE6",
    @text="One of the most dangerous things you can believe in this world is that technology is neutral.",
    @location="197"
  >
]
```

Additionally, each book has it's own `highlights_from_amazon` method:

```
book = kindle.books.first
book.highlights_from_amazon
```

### Advanced Usage

This gem uses [mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize) to interact with Amazon's Kindle pages. You can override any of the default mechanize settings (see `lib/kindle_highlights/client.rb`) by passing your settings to the initializer:

```ruby
kindle = KindleHighlights::Client.new(
  email_address: "me@example.com",
  password: "amazon_password",
  mechanize_options: { user_agent_alias: 'Mac Safari' }
)
```

### A Note About CAPTCHAs

Amazon will sometimes issue a CAPTCHA challenge when logging in to your
Kindle account. If this happens when the gem attempts to log in to your
Kindle account to retrieve your book list or highlights, you'll get a `KindleHighlights::Client::CaptchaError`, like the following:

```ruby
> kindle.books
KindleHighlights::Client::CaptchaError: Received a CAPTCHA while attempting to sign in to your Amazon account. You will need to resolve this manually at https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.pape.max_auth_age=0&openid...
```

There's no way to programmatically resolve this situation. The best
solution I've found is to open a browser, visit the URL that the gem returns, log in to
your Kindle account, and click around a bit. Then log out of your Kindle
account and re-attempt to fetch your highlights via this gem. Additionally, you could try
instantiating a new instance of the client and changing the User-Agent
via `mechanize_options` like:

```ruby
kindle = KindleHighlights::Client.new(
  email_address: "me@example.com",
  password: "amazon_password",
  mechanize_options: { user_agent_alias: 'iPhone' }
)
```
