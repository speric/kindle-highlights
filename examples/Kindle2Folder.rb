# Kindle2Folder.rb Script
# This example script uses the kindle-highlights script to create a seperate .txt file for each book in your collection in the 
# Amazon Kindle Notebook.  Each file contains the name of the book and author, and then adds each highlight below it with the 
# page number/location and any associated notes.  Finally it adds a link to the highlight in the desktop version of the kindle 
# app using the "kindle://" url scheme.
